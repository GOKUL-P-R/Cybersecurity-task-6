# Cybersecurity-task-6
This project demonstrates creating and testing strong passwords using online tools, summarizing password security best practices, and exploring how password complexity protects against common attacks like brute force and dictionary methods
# Step 1: Create a New Directory

# Step 2: Create README.md (copy your completed README content)
echo "# Task 6: Creating and Evaluating Strong Passwords

## Objective
Understand strong password principles by creating multiple passwords, evaluating their strength using online tools, and documenting best practices.

## Password Creation and Strength Evaluation

| Password        | Strength (%) | Feedback            |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| P@ssword123     | 80          | Good length, mixed types |
| S3cur3!Key2025  | 95          | Very strong, highly complex |
| qwerty          | 10          | Weak: too common |
| 42G\\$mplX#xyz!R  | 98          | Excellent complexity |
| test123         | 20          | Weak: lacks symbols |

## Best Practices and Tips Learned
- Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols in passwords.
- Avoid common words, simple patterns, or personal information.
- Passwords should be at least 12 characters for best security.
- Unique and unpredictable combinations are most secure.

## Research: Password Attack Methods
- Brute Force Attacks: Automated tools try all combinations. Strong, long passwords resist better.
- Dictionary Attacks: Attackers use lists of common words/phrases. Avoid dictionary words for stronger protection.
